I can speak Japanese, Korean, and English, but can't speak or understand Chinese. In Japan, we use China word system called 'Kanji'(Chinese character). This system shares most of it. "Most".

If you look at this Chinese character '見', Japan and Korea use the same character but Chinese is slightly different(见).

In most cases, it won't be a problem at all. Most lyrics use the Japanese kanji character. and I can understand in most cases. However, it is a bit annoying. Why? Well, I can not know every Chinese Character! Yeah, I can understand 'some' character, but after all, it is a foreign language to me.
